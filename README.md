# DogDetector
A CNN that can detect dogs and predict their breed. If a human face is input, it will tell you what breed the person looks like.

# Future Work
This app ideally would show you the face it detects in the uploaded image along with a heatmap of activation regions. Additionally,
the output should show the original input image with these detection features added alongside a picture of the predicted dog
breed. This would help in identifying whether the model is way off base (in the case where it is actually predicting a dog breed)
or just give the chance to laugh if it's comparing humans to dogs :)
